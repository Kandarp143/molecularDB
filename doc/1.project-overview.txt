------------------ TECHNICAL OVERVIEW ------------------

This project(database) is completely developed in open source web technologies mentioned as follow

Front End   : HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery
Back End    : PHP
Database    : MySQL
Author      : Kandarp Patel (kppatel14392@gmail.com)
Mentor      : Simon Stephan (simon.stephan@mv.uni-kl.de)
Department  : Lehrstuhl fÃ¼r Thermodynamik, TU Kaiserslautern


I have tried to create overall project(database) with comments in each page for better readability.
However, Overall project overview is as follow.


------------------ PROJECT STRUCTURE ------------------

This project contains following files and folders. Purpose of all folders and files are described here.

Project Folder (Path)  : moleculeDB/
Entry File             : index.php
Config File            : config.php (described in senario)
Root Files             : project master files which can be considered as main files,
                         uses the other resources from following folders.

Folders (moleculeDB/)
- css/          ---> include global stylesheets of project
- doc/          ---> contains all documents related to this project
- fonts/        ---> custom downloaded font used by stylesheets for this project
- function/     ---> function which contains algorithms used throughout this project
- gen/          ---> include auto generated pm/ls files and logs.
- img/          ---> contains all images used in this project
- include/      ---> contains sub files, which are includes by root files
- js/           ---> all JavaScript files used in project
- mailer/       ---> e-mail library for email function
- test/         ---> test files which were created at the start of the project. not                                      used in current working project

------------------ LIST OF DIPLAY FILES (FRONT END to BACK END) ------------------

To change static contents from any page in database, best way to track files from front end.

Steps:
- open database in browser
- find any content needs to be change
- read URL of browser (http://localhost/molecularDB/mollist.php?###)
- check which page is opened in browser
- go to that page (ex. mollist.php) from backend, find content that want to change
- if not found, check for the 'include' tag. (ex. include 'include/footer.php' ) which  contain some included file (ex. footer.php)
- open that included file (ex. footer.php) and find content
- change content

Note : for home page(http://localhost/molecularDB/)--> 'index.php'
Detailed scenario with screenshots are described in separate file (admin-scenario.php)


Following are list of files, which are displayed in the browser. So it may help admin to edit static contents of website.


DISPLAYED PAGE              BACKEND PAGE
---------------             ---------------
/* user pages */

Home page                   index.php/welcome.php
Molecule List               mollist.php
Molecule Detail             moldetail.php
Reference List              reflist.php
Nomenclature                normen.php
contact                     contact.php

/* admin pages */

New Molecule                addmol.php
New Reference               addRef.php
Update Molecule             updatemol.php
Delete Molecule             deletemol.php
Update Reference            updateRef.php
Delete Reference            deleteRef.php


------------------ FILE NAMING CONVENTION ------------------

overall naming convention of project files are as follow.

FILENAME PATTERN           PURPOSE
----------------           ----------
'##list'                   file contain molecule list/reference list display
'update##'                 file contain update algorithm for molecule/reference
'delete##'                 file contain delete algorithm for molecule/reference
'add##'                    file contain insert algorithm for molecule/reference
'process##'                all process files after user submit/user action
'##Func'                   file contains function which used in project


throughout the project I have used some shortcuts in file name to understand what that file means.

ABBREVIATION               IDEA
-------------              -------
'mol'                      molecule
'ref'                      reference
'norm'                     nomenclature
'mst'                      master data
'det'                      detail data
'down'                     download
'gen'                      generate
'up'                       update
'delete'                   delete
'add'                      insert
'head'                     header



I think, mentioned information are enough to get idea about the purpose of file, by seeing filename

FOR EXAMPLE
------------

1.processUpRef  = process + Up + Ref
- process : contain logic after user submit some data
- Up : update logic
- Ref : reference data
- Overall idea : this file contain logic when admin request for update some specific reference

2.updatemol = update + mol
- update : update form
- mol : of molecule
- Overall idea : this file contain form of updating molecule

3.processUpdateHead: = process + update + head
- process : after submit form logic
- update  : update logic
- head    : header data  ( reference or molecule - but reference don't have data in parts, molecule have -> header + detail)
- Overall idea : this file contain logic to process data after user submit from for update molecule header.

Detailed scenario with screenshots are described in separate file (3.admin-scenario.pdf)
